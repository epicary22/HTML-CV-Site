          <p>
            I am a cool guy. Not your normal cool guy though, I like to draw, program, solve hard math problems, and just generally spend time with my wonderful friends. Thus, I am cool in more ways than just one. I can look like hackerman if I want while also calculating the <em>very</em> messy 4th derivatives of strange functions. I aspire to be a programmer when I grow up, but as of right now, I have a lot of fun just programming small things in my free time. As well, I really like drawing but not showing people what I do draw because it's my very own (at least for Sketchbook I). I could put some more personal info but what if someone finds this? I don't want my credit card stolen!!
